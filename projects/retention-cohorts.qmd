# Retention Cohorts

This project simulates how retention changes over time for different user cohorts.  

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(123)
cohorts <- tibble(
  cohort = rep(1:3, each = 12),
  month = rep(1:12, times = 3),
  retention = round(100 * exp(-0.2*month) + rnorm(36, 0, 5))
)

cohorts %>%
  ggplot(aes(month, retention, color = factor(cohort))) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Simulated Retention Cohorts", y = "Retention (%)", x = "Months")
